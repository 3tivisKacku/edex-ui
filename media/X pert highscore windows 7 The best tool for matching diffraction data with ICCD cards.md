2. Run the setup file and follow the instructions on the screen. You can choose the default settings or customize them according to your preferences.
3. After the installation is complete, launch the software from the Start menu or the desktop shortcut.
4. Enter your license key when prompted. You can also register your software online for updates and support.
5. Load the ICCD data cards from the File menu. These are reference data for various materials that you can use for phase identification. You can download them from the developer's website[^1^] or use your own data cards.

## Basic Usage
 
To analyze your X-ray diffraction data with X'Pert HighScore Plus, you need to follow these steps:

1. Import your data file from the File menu. You can choose from different file formats such as XRDML, ASCII or binary. You can also drag and drop your file into the software window.
2. View your data in different modes such as scan, pattern or structure. You can zoom in or out, adjust the scale, change the background or apply smoothing filters.
3. Perform phase identification by clicking on the Identify button. The software will compare your data with the ICCD data cards and display the best matches. You can refine your results by changing the search parameters such as range, tolerance or threshold.
4. Perform crystallographic analysis by clicking on the Analyze button. The software will calculate various parameters such as unit cell, space group, lattice parameters or symmetry elements. You can also perform indexing, refinement or space group test.
5. Perform cluster analysis by clicking on the Cluster button. The software will group your data into different clusters based on similarity or dissimilarity criteria. You can change the cluster method, distance measure or number of clusters.
6. Perform profile fits by clicking on the Fit button. The software will fit your data with different models such as pseudo-Voigt, Pearson VII or split Pearson VII. You can adjust the fit parameters such as peak shape, peak width or peak position.
7. Perform Rietveld/structure fits by clicking on the Rietveld button. The software will fit your data with a crystal structure model based on atomic coordinates and occupancies. You can modify the structure model, refine the structure parameters or calculate structure factors.

## Conclusion
 
X'Pert HighScore Plus is a comprehensive software for X-ray diffraction data analysis. It can help you to identify phases, analyze crystal structures, perform cluster analysis, fit profiles and perform Rietveld/structure fits. It is compatible with Windows 7 and supports various file formats and databases. You can download it from the developer's website[^1^] and use it with a license key.
