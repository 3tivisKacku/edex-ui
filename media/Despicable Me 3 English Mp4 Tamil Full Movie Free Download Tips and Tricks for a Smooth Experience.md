## Some Fun Facts About Despicable Me 3
 
Despicable Me 3 is not only a hilarious and heartwarming movie, but also a movie full of interesting trivia and references. Here are some fun facts about Despicable Me 3 that you may not know:

- This is the first film that Gru didn't use Freeze Ray, despite he was holding, and then disarmed by Balthazar Bratt[^2^].
- Steve Carell said that this movie may be his last as the voice of Gru. However, Carell stated that if he was asked to do a cameo in any future Minion sequels, he happily would. In Minions: The Rise of Gru (2022), Carell was confirmed to reprise his role as Gru[^1^].
- Trey Parker stated that his daughter was a key factor in his decision to take the role of Balthazar Bratt.

Parker is best know as co-Creator of South Park (1997), with partner Matt Stone[^1^].

This is the same name as a similar fictional European country in the The Marx Brothers movie Duck Soup (1933). The name of the diamond Bratt tries to steal is the Dumont Diamond, named after Margaret Dumont, who played the recurring "straight man" character in a great many Marx Brothers movies, including Duck Soup (1933)[^1^].
- Margo's shirt has The Grinch on it. This is a reference to Illumination's next movie[^1^].
