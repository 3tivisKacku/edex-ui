## Who are the main characters of Mahabharat?
 
Mahabharat has a large cast of characters, each with their own role and significance in the epic. However, some of the main characters that drive the plot and the war are:

- **Krishna**: Krishna is the supreme god of Hinduism, who incarnates as a human to help the Pandavas in their struggle against the Kauravas. He is the cousin and friend of Arjuna, and acts as his charioteer and guide in the battlefield. He delivers the famous discourse on dharma and action known as the Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna before the war begins. He is also the mastermind behind many strategies and interventions that ensure the victory of the Pandavas.
- **The Pandavas**: The Pandavas are the five sons of Pandu, who are rightful heirs to the throne of Hastinapura. They are Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva. They are virtuous, brave, loyal, and devoted to dharma. They share a common wife, Draupadi, who is also a key figure in the epic. They face many hardships and challenges due to the enmity of their cousins, the Kauravas, who try to usurp their kingdom and humiliate them. They fight for justice and righteousness in the Kurukshetra War.
- **The Kauravas**: The Kauravas are the hundred sons of Dhritarashtra, who are born of a demonic nature. They are led by Duryodhana, who is ambitious, arrogant, greedy, and wicked. He is jealous of the Pandavas and plots to destroy them with the help of his uncle Shakuni, who is a master of deceit and manipulation. He challenges Yudhishthira to a rigged dice game and wins his kingdom, wealth, and wife. He refuses to give back even a needlepoint of land to the Pandavas when they return from exile. He commands a huge army of warriors and allies in the war against the Pandavas.
- **Karna**: Karna is a tragic hero in Mahabharat. He is actually the eldest son of Kunti, who abandons him at birth due to fear of social stigma. He is adopted by a charioteer named Adhiratha and grows up as a suta (a mixed caste). He is gifted with extraordinary skills in archery and warfare, but faces discrimination and rejection from society due to his low birth. He becomes a loyal friend of Duryodhana, who gives him respect and recognition. He joins the Kaurava side in the war, despite knowing that he is fighting against his own brothers. He is killed by Arjuna with Krishna's help.
- **Bhishma**: Bhishma is one of the most revered and respected characters in Mahabharat. He is the son of King Shantanu and Ganga, and the granduncle of both Pandavas and Kauravas. He vows to remain celibate and serve whoever sits on the throne of Hastinapura for his father's sake. He is a great warrior, statesman, teacher, and advisor. He tries to maintain peace and harmony between the two sides, but fails to prevent the war. He fights on behalf of the Kauravas out of duty, but does not support their evil deeds. He falls on a bed of arrows after being wounded by Arjuna on Krishna's advice.
